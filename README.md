# Prime Multiplication Table - Code Sample

This project is just a code sample

### Preparation
After cloning enter in the project folder and run
```shell
bundle install
```

#### How to run

The simplest way to run is without parameters, this will use the first 10 prime numbers
```shell
ruby main.rb
```

You can also specify the amount of prime numbers
```shell
ruby main.rb 20
```

#### Additional Information

This project is more about code design than algorithm, that's why we don't aim to generate primes using the best algorighm ever made, this is just a detail, a little piece of the whole project.
We could also improve the way we generate the table since there are lots of results that are already calculated in other lines.

For instance we can easily change the project to use the ruby [Prime class](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.3.0/libdoc/prime/rdoc/Prime.html).


I hope you enjoy reading this code as much I enjoyed coding it. :beers:
